    <li><h4>Pigs in a Blanket</h4>
        <p>Best of all, they only require three ingredients, hot dogs,
         crescent rolls, and American cheese, 
        and take less than 30 minutes to make.</p></li>
    <li><h4>Chicken Wings</h4>
        <p>These chicken wings may be messy, 
            but they taste so good, no one will mind. 
            The chicken is juicy, tender, and fried to perfection.</p></li>
    <li><h4>Mac and Cheese Bites</h4>
        <p>These bite-sized balls of yum have crunchy, 
            garlicky outsides and gooey, cheesy insides. 
            They take over an hour to make, but they are 
            always the biggest hit at the party.</p></li>
    <li><h4>Crispy Onion Rings</h4>
        <p>They have extraordinarily crispy, crunchy outsides, 
            and the onions within are soft, tender, and tasty.
            The smoked paprika in the recipe also gives them a kick,
             which makes them even better. </p></li>
